You have to do almost nothing to use it but i'll still list the steps below-
1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and copy your token
2. Go to the config.json file and paste your token and add a prefix
3. And now you can run it!
4. do `npm install` to install all the dependencies and `node server.js` to run your bot
### If this worked for you you may star and fork it!! If you still have any doubts or erorrs you may join my server

}
