# NQN_Remake
This is a small function of my discord bot [Zeyron](https://dsc.gg/zeyron) and i thought i might open source it for you to use it!


You have to do almost nothing to use it but i'll still list the steps below-
1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and copy your token
2. Go to the [server.js](https://github.com/crypto195/nqn_rmake/server.js) file and replace "bot-token-here" with the token that you had copied before
3. And now you can run it!

### If this worked for you you may star and fork it!! If you still have any doubts or erorrs you may join my [server](https://discord.gg/dmwBs6frJe)
